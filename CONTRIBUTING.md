## Commits and Releases

This repo follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/). Every PR title
must conform — it becomes the squash-merge commit message on `main` and drives automated releases.

### Allowed types

| Type       | When to use                              | Version bump (pre-1.0)     |

### Good PR title examples ✅

```
feat: add uninstall script
fix: handle missing backup directory on first run
chore: update README install instructions
feat!: rename backup directory from widgets/ to widget-snapshots/
docs: add troubleshooting section to README
```

### Bad PR title examples ❌

```
fixed stuff              # no type prefix
Feature/uninstall        # branch name, not a commit message
WIP: backup changes      # not a Conventional Commits type
update scripts           # vague, no type
```

### How releases work

After a PR merges to `main`, release-please opens a Release PR within ~1 minute. Once all required
status checks pass on that PR, GitHub automatically squash-merges it — cutting the release, tagging
the version, and publishing the changelog. No manual merge step needed.
